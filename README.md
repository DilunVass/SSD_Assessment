## Introduction
This project simulates an online banking system designed to provide a comprehensive range of banking services. It allows users to register, log in securely, manage accounts, and perform various transactions. Key features include money deposits and withdrawals, recipient management, fund transfers between accounts, transaction history viewing, and appointment scheduling. The system is built with two distinct roles—user and administrator—to ensure proper access control and functionality distribution.
The backend is developed using the Spring Boot framework, while the frontend leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience. MySQL serves as the database management system, handling secure storage and retrieval of user and transaction data.
A significant focus of this project is on addressing and fixing security vulnerabilities, ensuring system reliability, and improving maintainability. By implementing security best practices, the system enhances data protection and integrity, making it robust and efficient for real-world usage.
